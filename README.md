<h1 align="center">Miasma</h1>
<p align="center"><i>A Heroku-like, docker based PaaS with cluster and ARM support</i><p>

### Huh? What does that even mean?

- Deploy apps from a CLI similar to Heroku
- Apps are ran in Docker Swarm as docker containers
- You can add as many nodes/devices as you want to form a cluster
- The `aklinker1/miasma` docker image is published with ARM support

### What makes Miasma unique?

- The only PaaS that supports both **clusters** and **ARM devices**
- Built for a home network of Raspberry Pis (and other computers) in your closet
