# GraphQL API

The Miasma server ships with a GraphQL API for accessing and editing apps. Once you're server has been started, you can access it at:

`http://<server-ip>:3000/graphql`

## Playground

The API includes a GraphiQL playground that lets you experiment with the API from the browser. No additional tools necessary! You can access it at:

`http://<server-ip>:3000/playground`

## Introspection

The API also supports introspection so you can get docs inside a HTTP client like Insomnia or Postman.
