# Plugins

Plugins are predefined apps that have additional setup steps or integrations with Docker or Miasma that normal apps do not.

Currently, there is only 1 plugin:

- [`TRAEFIK`: ingress router](./traefik.md)

This is because everything else (databases, registries, other "common" apps) can be configured and managed as plain apps - See templates.
