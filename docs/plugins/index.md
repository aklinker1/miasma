# Plugins

Plugins are predefined apps that have additional setup steps or integrations with Docker or Miasma that normal apps do not.

- [`TRAEFIK`](./traefik.md): ingress router

All other "common" apps (databases, registries, and shared services) can be configured and managed as [plain apps](/guide/examples).
