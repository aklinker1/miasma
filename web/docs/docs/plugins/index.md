title: Plugins Overview
---

Plugins are predefined apps that have additional setup steps or integrations with docker that normal apps do not have.

Currently, there is only 1 plugin:

- [`traefik`](/plugins/traefik): ingress router

This is because everything else (databases, registries, other "common" apps) can all be configured and managed as plain apps.
